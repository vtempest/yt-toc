### Features
It is hard to consume long Youtube videos or other videos or podcasts.

We leverage Claude API to help come up with topics - a table of contents - for the multimedia content.

We further present a short synopsis of each topic in the ToC. Users can quickly read to get a gist of the whole video.

The user can now jump to the topic / timestamp that is of interest to them.

Here is a demo for Youtube. But this can be extended to any multimedia content that is long form.
